# Overview
A collection of instructions that I often use to tweak and improve my experience while using my daily Linux machine.

The goal of this repository is to have all instructions documented so they are easy to access whenever I (or someone else) needs them to accomplish a task based on these guidelines.

# Quick Note
I just want to make it clear that these are the settings that **I LIKE TO USE FOR MY SETUP.** Feel free to change the settings to your liking.
