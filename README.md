# Overview
A gathering of instructions that I often use to tweak and create a better experience while using my daily linux machine.

The goal of this repository is to have all instructions documented so it's easy to access whenever I (or someone else) need it in order to accomplish something within these guidelines.

# Quick Note
I just want to make it clear that these are the settings that **I LIKE TO USE ON MY SETUP.** Feel free to change the settings to your liking.
